# DS and Algo
This repo contains worked problems I've completed related to Data Structures and Algorithms (since I've started documenting them at least, this is by no means comprehensive). 

Unfortunately, I didn't make it a point to document all of the problems when I started completing problems so the initial problems in this repo may lack proper context/instructions or have some poor documentation. On the whole though, the documentation is fairly well defined, particularly as I complete more and more problems. 

Many of the problems are from LeetCode, Introduction to Algorithms, or Cracking the Coding Interview (I try to provide links to the problems when I can). I did try to create (or at least use) test cases for each problem but of course it can be quite time intensive so many problems only have a few test cases. Luckily many of the problems are from LeetCode, which provides test cases (which is handy for studying but writing test cases is an art of its own of course).

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I'm the CTO of [Clips](https://www.clipsai.com/) (checkout the link for more information!) which heavily utilizes machine learning, specifically deep learning and natural language processing. I've decided to complete a few public courses in machine learning and deep learning, namely Andrew Ng's famous[CS229: Machine Learning](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018), [EECS498/CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://github.com/bensmidt/EECS-498-DL-Computer-Vision) (Justin Johnson), and CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing (Christopher Manning) to gain some serious theoretical and hands-on knowledge in machine leaning. 

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Michigan for making these lectures and course material publically available! I've really enjoyed this course (Justin Johnson is a great professor) and it's been immensely helpful in learning deep learning!
