\section*{Algorithms Review}
\end{center}

\noindent This document serves as my personal review of algorithms used in programming. 
I expect this document to begin with only the most fundamental concepts: binary search, merge sort, 
quick sort, etc. As I learn more though, I expect this document to become quite lengthy. This 
document will not serve as an in-depth review of everything, but rather will hold only the most vital content
to remember. It's my intention to link longer explanations of individual concepts to separate documents, 
particularly those which are more complex or have more to remember.
